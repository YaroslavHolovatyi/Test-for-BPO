 - Xlsx package
 - SCSS preprocessor

# Full report
Firstly, it took me two days to understand and start using Angular framework. In order to uderstand this framework i used Angular documentation (https://angular.io/docs) and a course provided by Udemy.com on Angular by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller (2021 Edition). After i understood the basics and tried to make several components i moved on. (12.04-14.04)
Secondly, i have made a lot of efforts to inegrate the spreadsheet information from E-Cl@ss.zip into the project. For implementation of this part of test, i started using the third party library XLSX.js in order to import spreadsheets into my angular project. After specification of the task, I converted Excel Spreadsheets into JSON with the package "convert-excel-to-json" (https://www.npmjs.com/package/convert-excel-to-json).(14.04-15.04)
On Thursday I also prioritized creating AG Grid table for the conetnets of the spreadsheets and created them. I Have also used specific UI called Ignite UI as I found iformation that this package is good for creating such tables. (15.04 - 17.04)
On Sunday the only feature i Could create was implementation of search of keywords and values through the project (18.04).
Unfortunatelly i was not capable of creating a table with AG Grid on Search initialization, Search input to look for the Classes and Properties through the spreadsheets and th make a dashboard beacuase searching for this kind of information took me  too much time ind i had to proritize other tasks, I was capable to do.
